Tinitaly DTM as Google Earth Engine image collection asset. 
Tinitaly Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is an Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) product. It is an image collection of tiles of italian peninsula with a single band that corresponds to the (orthometric) elevation of bare ground. The spatial accuracy is 10m, projection is UTM WGS 84 zone 32 (EPSG: 32632). The asset is available on Google Earth Engine at: https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=projects/ee-emanuelespiritowork/assets/Tinitaly_DTM
I suggested uploading as official dataset of Earth Engine at https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/404066177 and as a community dataset at https://github.com/samapriya/awesome-gee-community-datasets/issues/339

From this file I also extracted the italian nation shapefile, that is available at https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=projects/ee-emanuelespiritowork/assets/Italy_shapefile
